# MorphogenicSimulator
An open-source, ethically-grounded framework for simulating reality across layers—from quantum substrates to conceptual emergence.

## Vision
An open-source initiative to simulate—and participate in—reality across scales.  
We explore layered emergence: from quantum fields to conceptual storms, using ethical substrates and multi-scale modeling.

## Ethics
- Do no harm.
- Prioritize voluntary interaction.
- Remain open, accessible, and transparent.

## Structure
- `theory/`: Deep riffs on reality, observation, and emergence.
- `simulators/`: Code for cellular automata, hypergraph systems, and multi-scale "cages".
- `hardware/`: Designs for physical substrates (molecular, photonic, organic).
- `chaos_bombs/`: Half-formed ideas waiting to explode into clarity.
- `DEVLOG.md`: Our living log of progress and insight.

## Get Involved
We welcome thinkers, coders, poets, and rebels.  
Read, experiment, document, discuss.  
Let’s grow this reality together.
